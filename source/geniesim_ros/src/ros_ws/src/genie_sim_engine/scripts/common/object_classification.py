"""Object (shape) name classification — shared by every contact-param
authoring path on the MJW side.

Companion to :mod:`common.joint_classification`.  The joint classifier
buckets actuator DOFs by class so per-class PD gains land on the right
DOFs; this one buckets *colliders* by class so per-class contact
compliance (solref / solimp) lands on the right shapes.

Why a Python-side classifier instead of USD ``mjc:*`` attributes:

  * Scenes here are authored in IsaacSim, not MuJoCo.  Authoring
    ``mjc:solref`` per prim during IsaacSim composition is awkward and
    bleeds MJ-specific knobs into asset files that other solvers ignore.
  * Most tuning is reproduced from pure-python ``mujoco.MjModel``
    experiments.  Keeping the canonical values in Python — alongside
    diff-able default tables — lets the same constants flow back into
    those scripts.
  * One central classifier means a new scene only needs to label its
    prims (``/World/<name>`` or ``<robot_prefix>/<link>``) for the
    classifier to bucket them automatically.  No per-asset USD edits.

Object kinds (``OK_*`` string constants — string instead of an Enum
for the same reason as joint kinds):

  - ``OK_ROBOT``        — any collider under the active robot's prim
                          path (matched by ``robot_prefix``).
  - ``OK_FLOOR``        — the ground plane added by
                          ``builder.add_ground_plane()`` (no USD prim;
                          identified by ``GeoType.PLANE`` + ``body == -1``).
  - ``OK_PASSIVE``      — passive scene rigid bodies (hanger, dropped
                          objects).  Identified by ``body`` index that
                          isn't part of the robot's articulation but
                          isn't world-static either.
  - ``OK_STATIC_PROP``  — world-static USD shapes that aren't the ground
                          plane (cube props, tables, walls in
                          ``/World/*``).
  - ``OK_OTHER``        — anything that didn't match.

The classifier is name + topology based (label, body index, shape type)
so it works on Newton's flat model arrays after ``builder.finalize()``,
without re-walking the USD stage.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape_label
        The ``model.shape_label[i]`` string.  Usually the USD prim path
        (``/World/hanger/geometry``, ``/genie/.../link_mesh``) or a
        synthetic label like ``ground_plane`` for ``add_ground_plane``.
    body_index
        The ``model.shape_body[i]`` value.  ``-1`` means world-static.
    body_label
        ``model.body_label[body_index]`` when ``body_index >= 0``.
        Used for prefix matching the robot.
    shape_type_int
        ``int(model.shape_type[i])`` — compared against ``plane_geo_type``
        to recognise the ground plane without importing Newton enums
        in this module.
    robot_prefix
        The active robot's USD prefix (e.g. ``"genie"``).  Shapes whose
        owning body's label starts with ``/<robot_prefix>/`` are robot.
    plane_geo_type
        ``int(newton.GeoType.PLANE)`` — passed by the caller to avoid an
        import on this module.

# Default contact-compliance table (MuJoCo-style solref / solimp)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Every class uses ``solref=(0.002, 1.0)`` — 2 ms time constant at
# critical damping.  The choice is driven by two MuJoCo-side facts that
# together fix the dampratio at exactly 1.0:
#
#   1. Stability floor: MJW's contact integrator requires
#      ``timeconst >= 2 * sub_dt``.  At ``physics_hz=100`` with
#      ``physics_solver_substep=10`` the sub-dt is 1 ms, so 2 ms is the
#      tightest stable timeconst.
#
#   2. Spring constant inversion: MJW recomputes contact stiffness from
#      ``shape_material_ke / kd`` each step via
#      ``ke = (1/(timeconst·dampratio))²`` (see ``mjc_contact.py``).
#      Holding timeconst constant and raising dampratio DROPS ke as the
#      square — at timeconst=2 ms, dampratio=1 gives ke=250 000 while
#      dampratio=5 gives ke=10 000 (25× softer spring).  Steady-state
#      penetration under a load F scales as ``F·(timeconst·dampratio)²``,
#      so an "overdamped" contact paradoxically sinks deeper, not less.
#
#   Critical damping (dampratio=1) is the unique sweet spot: maximum
#   spring stiffness at a given timeconst with no oscillation.  Below 1
#   the contact bounces; above 1 the spring weakens.
#
# MuJoCo's pair mix rule for solref is MAX of the two timeconsts (softer
# side wins), so every class has to be tight — leaving any one at MJ's
# stock ``(0.02, 1.0)`` drags the pair to 20 ms timeconst and ~4 mm
# steady-state penetration regardless of how tight the other side is.
#
# The reference G2 MJCF keeps the floor soft (``<geom name="floor"
# solref="0.02 1"/>``) for parity with upstream samples; we diverge
# here because the visible penetration is more confusing than the
# MJCF compatibility is useful.
#
# ``solimp`` is left at MuJoCo's stock ``(0.9, 0.95, 0.001, 0.5, 2.0)``
# for every class.
#
# Override per-class via the scene yaml ``newton.mjc_contact:`` block.
# Any class omitted there falls back to the value here.  This module is
# the in-code source of truth so values flow back to the pure-python
# mujoco scripts the user tunes against.
