"""Joint name classification — shared by every PD-authoring path.

Both layers of the Isaac-Sim drive stack (``usd_drive_api`` /
``articulation_view_runtime`` in ``config/physics_params.yaml``) bucket
joints by the same rules so the per-class gains in those blocks land on
the same DOFs.  This module is where that rule lives.

It also exists so newton-standalone (``engine/newton/adapters/
mujoco_warp.py``) can use the same classifier without depending on
``kit/stage.py`` (which would drag in Pxr + Isaac Sim imports the
standalone path doesn't have).  Callers without USD prim handles use
``classify_joint_by_name`` + ``is_chassis_wheel_free``; callers with
prims use the convenience wrapper ``classify_joint``.

Joint kinds (``JK_*`` string constants — string instead of an Enum
because YAML / JSON / log lines all consume them as strings, and we
don't want every consumer to import an enum class just to compare):

  - ``JK_BODY``           — torso / body chain
  - ``JK_ARM``            — arm-shoulder / mid / wrist
  - ``JK_HEAD``           — head / neck
  - ``JK_GRIPPER``        — gripper master + mimics
  - ``JK_CHASSIS_DRIVE``  — free-spin road wheel (huge limits)
  - ``JK_CHASSIS_STEER``  — bounded-limit steering joint
  - ``JK_CHASSIS_WHEEL``  — chassis wheel before drive/steer split
                            (returned by name-only classification)
  - ``JK_OTHER``          — anything that didn't match a regex

The "drive vs steer" split needs a numeric joint-limit check, so
``classify_joint_by_name`` returns ``JK_CHASSIS_WHEEL`` and lets the
caller refine with ``is_chassis_wheel_free`` once it has the limits.
The Pxr wrapper ``classify_joint`` does this refinement automatically.
