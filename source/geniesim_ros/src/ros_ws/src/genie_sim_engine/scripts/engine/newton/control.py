        """Forward joint targets from ROS into the adapter's target buffer(s).

        Each adapter owns its own position-target buffer:
          * mjwarp adapter:       ``control.joint_target_pos`` — what
                                  SolverMuJoCo's JOINT_TARGET actuators
                                  read each step.
          * featherstone adapter: a dedicated ``wp.array`` that the
                                  captured CUDA graph reads each substep
                                  via ``_kernel_velocity_inject_masked``
                                  (joint_qd = target − joint_q for
                                  controlled DOFs only).

        The buffer is mutated IN PLACE via the numpy bridge so the CUDA
        graph's captured pointer sees the new values.  Never reassign
        the array object — that creates a new pointer the graph can't
        reach.

        Three input channels reach this method:

          * ``cmd_positions``       — from ``/joint_command``.  ALL joint
                                      names land here regardless of joint
                                      kind (arm, head, body, gripper,
                                      and chassis_steer/chassis_drive
                                      via /joint_command).  Treated as
                                      position targets.
          * ``cmd_4ws_steer_pos``   — from ``/cmd_4ws``, names ending in
                                      ``joint1`` (the 4WS steer axis).
                                      Position target → same buffer as
                                      cmd_positions.
          * ``cmd_4ws_drive_vel``   — from ``/cmd_4ws``, names ending in
                                      ``joint2`` (the 4WS drive axis,
                                      mode=VELOCITY).  Velocity target
                                      → ``control.joint_target_vel``.

        ``cmd_4ws_stamp`` is the monotonic-now timestamp of the most
        recent ``/cmd_4ws`` message.  When the elapsed since that stamp
        exceeds ``cmd_4ws_timeout_s``, the 4WS channel is treated as
        stale and every chassis_drive DOF is force-braked to vel=0 to
        keep the robot from running away if /cmd_4ws stops publishing.
        ``cmd_4ws_steer_pos`` is left untouched on timeout (the steer
        joints' position-mode actuators just hold whatever target was
        last written — wheels at rest, not a runaway risk).  Mirrors
        the PhysX path in ``kit/stage.py::_apply_joint_commands``.

        Input units match the PhysX path / ROS conventions:
          * revolute  → radians   (positions and velocities)
          * prismatic → metres / metres-per-second
