# Threshold for treating ``joint_target_ke`` as "unset" by the URDF.
#
# Isaac Sim's URDF importer writes a vestigial ``DriveAPI`` with
# ``stiffness≈625`` on every revolute joint regardless of effort values
# in the source URDF.  Newton's ``add_usd`` reads that 625 into
# ``model.joint_target_ke``.  Anything below this threshold is treated as
# "the importer wrote a placeholder; substitute the launcher default."
#
# 626 is chosen to catch exactly the vestigial 625 while preserving
# intentional values >= 626 from XACRO ``<drive>`` tags (e.g. head ke=1000,
# arm-tip ke=8000).
_VESTIGIAL_KE_THRESHOLD = 626.0

# Default PD gains when the launcher YAML doesn't set
# ``mujoco_pd_ke`` / ``mujoco_pd_kd`` AND the URDF doesn't author
# ``joint_target_ke`` / ``joint_target_kd``.
#
# Fallback only — used when ``joint_effort_limit`` is also unavailable
# so we can't scale per-joint.  The preferred path is per-joint
# ``kp = effort_limit * _KE_TO_EFFORT_FACTOR`` so the spring never
# demands more torque than the actuator can deliver at small errors.
_DEFAULT_KE = 100.0
_DEFAULT_KD = 10.0

# Per-joint kp = effort_limit * _KE_TO_EFFORT_FACTOR.
# 10 means a 0.1 rad error demands exactly ``effort_limit`` — small
# corrections track linearly; large goals saturate during the
# transient and unclamp as error shrinks, which is the right behavior
# for position control on torque-limited actuators.  Going higher
# (e.g. 50) gives stiffer hold but saturates earlier.  Going lower
# (e.g. 2) gives softer hold but is unmistakable to read in RViz.
_KE_TO_EFFORT_FACTOR = 10.0

# Critical damping for a unit-inertia link: kd = 2 * sqrt(kp).  We use
# 2.0 to target critical damping under the worst-case assumption that
# m_eff ≈ 1 kg·m².  Most arm / body links are well under that, so we
# end up slightly over-damped — desirable, because mjwarp's
# ``implicitfast`` integrator is stable past nominal damping ratios
# and over-damping suppresses the ringing that follows every wbc
# step-input.  An under-damped value (< 1.0) makes the joint
# oscillate around each new goal, and the second-order modes from
# 42 joints fighting each other look like an explosion to the
# operator even when no single joint diverges.

# Mimic-master gains for the gripper master joint (the one that owns
# the open/close target via /joint_command).  Tuned to match the
# reference G2 MJCF (``gainprm="5" biasprm="0 -5"`` on
# ``position_idx31_gripper_l_inner_joint1``) — extremely soft, because
# the kinematic coupling between gripper joints comes from the mjwarp
# equality constraints Newton's importer derives from
# Gripper tuning constants — DELETED.  All gripper-related values
# (master kp/kd, master effort cap, mimic eq solref/solimp, joint
# armature/damping/frictionloss) now come from
# ``physics_params.yaml::usd_drive_api.gripper`` (see
# ``common/params.py:GripperDriveParams`` for the field list).  The
# adapter reads ``self._physics_params.drive_gripper.*`` everywhere
# a gripper-specific value is needed.  This removes the
# ``_GRIPPER_MASTER_KE/KD``, ``_MIMIC_AUTHORED_KE_FLOOR``,
# ``_MIMIC_JOINT_ARMATURE/FRICTIONLOSS/DAMPING`` constants and the
# accompanying overlay-snapshot logic — the YAML is the single
# source of truth.

# Default per-DOF actuator effort limit when the URDF didn't author
# ``<limit effort=...>`` for a joint.  mjwarp converts
# ``joint_effort_limit`` into mujoco's per-joint ``actfrclimited=True``
# + ``actfrcrange=(-eff, +eff)``; if eff is 0 (the Newton default for
# unspecified URDF effort), the actuator force is clamped to 0 N·m and
# the robot behaves like jelly regardless of how high ``ke`` is.  This
# value clamps "effectively unauthored" effort limits (anything <=
# ``_EFFORT_LIMIT_FLOOR``) up to ``_DEFAULT_EFFORT_LIMIT`` so the PD
# can actually deliver torque.  500 N·m is large enough for a humanoid

             ``effort ≈ 0``) which is a near-certain source of
             "joint-doesn't-track-commands" bugs.

          B. **No ``physics_params``** (no-params / standalone-tool path).
             Falls back to the per-effort heuristic ``ke = effort * 10``
             with critical-damping ``kd = 2·√ke``.  Used by

        mimic equality.

        Why this lives at the adapter (post-build) layer
        ------------------------------------------------
        Newton's MJCF converter emits mimic equalities at MuJoCo's
        default ``solref=[0.02, 1.0]`` / ``solimp=[0.9, 0.95, 0.001,
        0.5, 2.0]`` regardless of any USD ``mjc:solref`` /
        ``mjc:solimp`` we might author — the mimic emit path in
        ``solver_mujoco.py`` doesn't consume those custom attributes
        (see ``docs/newton_quirks.md``).  So the runtime gets the
        default soft form unless we mutate the live mjw_model
        explicitly.

        This method writes ``self._physics_params.drive_gripper
        .mimic_eq_solref`` (and ``.mimic_eq_solimp``) into the live
        arrays.  When the YAML values equal MuJoCo's defaults this is
        a no-op write.  When the user picks a stiff form (negative
        solref like ``[-10000, -100]``) it stiffens every gripper
        equality at runtime.

        The dumped MJCF text is patched separately by
        ``common/mjcf_postprocess.py:augment_mjcf_equality_solref`` so
        live and dump always carry identical equality stiffness.
