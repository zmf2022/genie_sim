"""Shared mimic-joint utilities for both physics-engine paths.

Newton's articulation does not honor multi-finger gripper ``<mimic>`` tags
the way PhysX does (PhysX has ``PhysxMimicJointAPI`` enforced at the
constraint level; Newton's wrapper has ``NewtonMimicAPI`` declared in
USD but its ``apply_action`` still requires every follower DOF to be
explicitly commanded). Both ``IsaacNewtonEngine`` and
``NewtonStandaloneEngine`` therefore have to broadcast a master target
across its followers in software.

The two engines diverged on this for a while:

  * isaac_newton (``runtime.stage._apply_joint_commands``) parsed
    ``NewtonMimicAPI`` from the staged USD.
  * newton-standalone (``engine.newton_standalone.topology._build_mimic_map``)
    re-parsed ``robot.urdf`` from disk via ``xml.etree``.

This module unifies both on the USD path. ``robot.urdf`` is upstream of
``assemble_robot`` and may not exist at runtime; the USD on the live
stage IS the source of truth (``NewtonMimicAPI`` is what the importer
authors and what the Newton wrapper actually reads).

The data shape is unchanged so call sites only need a one-line swap:

    {master_joint_name: [(follower_name, coef1, coef0), …]}

with the relation ``follower_q = coef0 + coef1 · master_q`` (matches
both Newton's USD schema and URDF's ``multiplier``/``offset`` — coef1
IS the URDF multiplier, coef0 IS the URDF offset).
