"""Build-phase mixins for ``NewtonHeadlessEngine``.

Each module owns one slice of the engine startup pipeline; the
``_build`` table-of-contents lives in :mod:`runtime`.  Composed
into ``_NewtonStandaloneBase`` (in ``engine_base.py``) via plain
multiple inheritance — no metaclasses, no auto-discovery.

File-system order mirrors execution order::

    stage      -> open stage + session-layer overrides
    model      -> ModelBuilder + add_usd + finalize
    normalize  -> mass clamp + contact mats + group/articulation unification
    solver     -> states + robot solver + cloth solver
    debug_pubs -> optional rclpy marker publishers
    init_pose  -> name maps + init_joint_pos + MJCF keyframe + state sync
    runtime    -> _build (TOC) + _warmup + _capture_graph + _dump_runtime_usd
