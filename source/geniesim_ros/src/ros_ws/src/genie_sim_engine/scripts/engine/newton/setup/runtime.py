        any runtime authoring we did before this point. Open the file in
        usdview / Isaac Sim to verify:

          * which physics colliders Newton would have parsed
          * what xforms got composed onto cloth / box prims

        USDRT layer that this snapshot would miss — what the asset
        pipeline gave Newton is the same thing Newton runs on.

        We export the ROOT LAYER ONLY (not the flattened stage) so the
        dump stays a small shell that references the cached payload
        files.  ``Stage.Export()`` flattens the composed stage and pulls
        every Mesh/inertia/collider inline — for the G2 + cloth scene
        that's a ~47 MB file with 99 % of its contents already
        identically present in ``payloads/geometries.usd``.  Exporting
        the root layer alone produces a few-KB file that opens
        identically in usdview/Isaac Sim because USD chases the
        references at load time.
