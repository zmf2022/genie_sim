"""Concrete Newton-standalone engine class.

``NewtonHeadlessEngine`` is the only engine class produced by this
subpackage — Kit-free, opens the USD stage with pure pxr, and inherits
its entire build / step / state surface from :class:`_NewtonStandaloneBase`
(in :mod:`engine_base`) which composes the build-phase mixins from
:mod:`engine.newton.setup` plus the runtime mixins (cloth, control,
plugin, state, stats, topology).

This module is intentionally tiny: it exists so the public surface
``from engine.newton import NewtonHeadlessEngine`` lands here without
dragging in the 900-line composition machinery.  Anything that touches
the build pipeline lives in :mod:`engine.newton.setup`; anything that
touches runtime state lives next to its mixin.
