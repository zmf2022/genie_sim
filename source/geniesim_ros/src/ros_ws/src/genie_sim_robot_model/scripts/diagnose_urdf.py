"""Diagnose and auto-fix URDF/xacro authoring problems.

What it checks
--------------
For each ``<link>`` in the input xacro/URDF file(s):

* **Missing ``<inertial>`` on a rigid-body link** (auto-fixable) — when
  a URDF link becomes a ``RigidBodyAPI`` prim in the converted USD AND
  lacks ``<inertial>``, PhysX falls back to "small sphere with negative
  mass" and emits

      [omni.physx.plugin] The rigid body at /<...> has a possibly invalid
      inertia tensor of {1.0, 1.0, 1.0} and a negative mass, small sphere
      approximated inertia was used.

  These warnings indicate the link will simulate with bogus dynamics —
  drive wheels may not push the body, the body may oscillate, contact
  responses may be wrong. The fix is to author an ``<inertial>`` block.

  The 6.0 converter applies ``RigidBodyAPI`` to **every** non-ghost-root
  link, so the rule flags any non-root link that has neither
  ``<inertial>`` nor ``<collision>`` — INCLUDING pure kinematic frames
  (TF anchors, branching mount frames, sensor frames). They are not
  exempt: a fixed-joint-connected frame with no mass still warns. Three
  cases are excluded:

    1. The URDF root link. KDL (used by ``robot_state_publisher`` and
       MoveIt) requires the root to be massless. Putting ``<inertial>``
       on the root produces "Root link X has inertial properties..."
       warnings and breaks downstream KDL consumers. (The root's own
       massless-rigid-body warning is the documented cost of the
       massless-root + ``_inertia``-sibling pattern.)
    2. The ``<X> + <X>_inertia`` sibling pattern (UR / vendor
       convention). The named link is a kinematic frame; the
       ``*_inertia`` sibling carries the mass.
    3. Links with a ``<collision>`` — PhysX auto-computes mass from the
       collision volume × density, so a missing ``<inertial>`` is fine.

  What's left is the set of non-root links that lack both ``<inertial>``
  and ``<collision>`` — exactly the real PhysX warnings.

* **URDF ghost root** (detect-only) — when the root link has no
  ``<visual>`` / ``<collision>`` / ``<inertial>``, the Isaac Sim 6.0
  URDF→USD converter takes its ``is_ghost_link`` branch and authors
  ``body0 = default_prim`` for every joint, including fixed joints.
  PhysX cannot construct an articulation from such USD. The tool can't
  auto-fix this — KDL forbids inertia on the root, so the fix must
  restructure the URDF (add visual/collision to the root, or start the
  kinematic chain at a non-ghost link).

* **Wheel without ``<cylinder>`` collision** (detect-only) — wheel-like
  links (name contains ``wheel`` or ``tire``, case-insensitive) benefit
  from a primitive ``<cylinder>`` collider rather than a triangle-mesh
  collider. Cylinder collision against a ground plane is ~10× faster
  than mesh-vs-mesh and numerically much more stable for sustained
  contact (the dominant workload on a mobile platform). The 6.0
  default-collision policy converts authored mesh colliders to convex
  hull, which is a workable but inferior alternative. The
  diagnose tool flags wheel-like links missing a cylinder collider so
  the operator can author one explicitly. This check is **detect-only**:
  the tool can't infer wheel radius / length from URDF text alone, so
  the fix must be authored by hand.

* **Mesh exported in non-metre units** (detect-only) — URDF / SDF /
  Newton / mjwarp / PhysX / RViz all assume mesh vertex data is in
  METRES.  COLLADA (``.dae``) lets the exporter declare a different
  unit via ``<unit meter="X"/>``, but no robotics loader honours
  the declaration — they read raw vertex values and treat them as
  metres.  When a CAD export with ``meter="0.001"`` (mm) leaks
  through, the loaded mesh is 1000× too large: inertia from
  uniform density is 10⁹× off, collision dispatch sees a giant
  hovering ghost-mesh, RViz shows the link blown up.

  This rule loads each ``<mesh filename>`` reachable from the
  URDF / xacro through ``trimesh`` and flags any whose vertex
  bounds extend past 5 m from origin — well past the spec of any
  human-scale robot link.  The reported file is the one to fix.
  Auto-fix is **not** in this tool; use the dedicated
  ``scripts/fix_dae_units.py`` (it rewrites the ``.dae`` vertices
  in place, with backup, structure-verified) — kept separate
  because the fix is mesh-data surgery, not text-substitution
  in the URDF.

* **Non-diagonal ``<inertia>`` tensor** (detect-only) — URDF inertia
  authored as a full 3×3 tensor with non-zero ``ixy`` / ``ixz`` / ``iyz``
  represents the same physical inertia as a diagonal tensor rotated by
  an ``<origin rpy>``, but the diagonal-plus-rpy form is:

    - what USD's ``PhysicsMassAPI`` actually stores
      (``diagonalInertia`` + ``principalAxes``) — the URDF→USD
      converter diagonalises either way, so the diagonal form removes
      one transformation;
    - what UR5's reference xacros do (``physical_parameters.yaml``
      lists ``ixy: 0, ixz: 0, iyz: 0`` for every link with the
      principal-axis rotation in ``inertia['rotation']``);
    - much easier to read — readers don't have to mentally
      diagonalise to see whether the tensor is well-conditioned;
    - what avoids the recurring "the inertia gizmo is rotated 45°
      from the visible mesh" GitHub issue (the
      ``recompute_inertia.py`` docstring's swiftpicker case).

  The rule flags any ``<inertia>`` whose
  ``max(|ixy|,|ixz|,|iyz|) / max(|ixx|,|iyy|,|izz|) > 1e-3`` — i.e.
  off-diagonals that aren't numerical noise.  Auto-fix is **not** in
  this tool; the fix needs the mesh (to recompute under uniform
  density) or a manual diagonalisation, both of which live in
  ``scripts/recompute_inertia.py`` and the per-package mesh-based
  recompute scripts.

* **Near-degenerate diagonal inertia with rpy=0** (detect-only) —
  when ``<inertia>`` is diagonal (``ixy=ixz=iyz=0``), ``<origin
  rpy="0 0 0">``, AND two of (``ixx``, ``iyy``, ``izz``) are within
  5% relative of each other, the link can trip an Isaac Sim ↔ Newton
  USD↔MJCF convention mismatch.  Isaac sorts ``diagonalInertia``
  ascending and emits a ``principalAxes`` quaternion; for certain
  sort permutations this is the 3-cycle quat ``(0.5, 0.5, 0.5,
  0.5)``.  Newton's ``SolverMuJoCo.save_to_mjcf`` then reads USD
  using the convention ``I_body = R · diag · Rᵀ`` while USD spec
  requires ``I_body = Rᵀ · diag · R`` — the two only differ for
  3-cycle R, which is exactly what Isaac wrote.  Result: MuJoCo
  shows the link's inertia tensor permuted by a cyclic shift (90°
  rotated ellipsoid) relative to RViz / URDF.  See
  ``newton_quirks.md`` for the full trace.

  The fix is **NOT** to snap the pair to exact equality — when
  ``ixx ≡ iyy`` Isaac still picks the cyclic permutation in the
  degenerate subspace, and the bug persists.  The actual workaround
  is two-step: (a) spread the near-degenerate pair to at least 6%
  relative gap, and (b) if the resulting sorted-ascending order is
  a 3-cycle of link axes (eg. ``izz<ixx<iyy``), swap two of D's
  entries so the order becomes a transposition.  Transpositions
  are invariant under the convention mismatch, so Newton's bug
  becomes invisible.  ``scripts/recompute_g2_inertia.py``
  implements both steps; this rule's purpose is to catch
  hand-authored URDFs that would land in the buggy regime.

What it does
------------
``--dry-run``: report every problem found, exit non-zero if any. Usable
as a CI gate.

Default (no ``--dry-run``): rewrite each affected file in place to fix
**only the auto-fixable problems** (currently: missing ``<inertial>``
blocks). Detect-only problems (wheel cylinder collision) are still
reported but not auto-fixed, and the tool exits non-zero so the
operator notices.

For the auto-fixable inertial check, the tool inserts:

    <inertial>
      <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
      <mass value="0.001"/>
      <inertia ixx="1e-6" iyy="1e-6" izz="1e-6" ixy="0" ixz="0" iyz="0"/>
    </inertial>

Six orders of magnitude below typical link masses — silences the
warning on frame-only links without affecting dynamics. **For
load-bearing links the operator must edit the placeholder to real
values** (mass + inertia matching the link's geometry); the tool can't
infer the correct values.

The tool operates on **xacro source** by default — fixing the xacro
means every regenerated URDF picks up the fix automatically. Plain
``.urdf`` files are also accepted (treated as static text), but if a
URDF is regenerated from xacro the fix would be wiped; fix the xacro
instead.

Self-closing ``<link name="X" />`` is expanded to a full block so the
``<inertial>`` block can be inserted as a child:

    <link name="X" />

becomes

    <link name="X">
      <inertial> ... </inertial>
    </link>

Links that already have ``<inertial>`` are left alone, regardless of
the values inside.

Usage
-----
::

    # Diagnose only — exits 1 if any problem is found.
    python3 diagnose_urdf.py --dry-run [PATH ...]

    # Auto-fix the auto-fixable problems.
    python3 diagnose_urdf.py [PATH ...]

PATH may be a file (``.xacro`` / ``.urdf.xacro`` / ``.urdf``) or a
directory (recursive scan). Default: current directory (recursive).

Mesh-developer workflow
-----------------------
1. Add or modify a ``<link>`` in the xacro.
2. Run ``python3 scripts/diagnose_urdf.py --dry-run robots/<vendor>``
   to see all flagged problems.
3. Run ``python3 scripts/diagnose_urdf.py robots/<vendor>`` to insert
   placeholder ``<inertial>`` blocks for the auto-fixable cases.
4. Edit each placeholder for load-bearing links to reflect real
   mass/inertia; leave the placeholder as-is for frame-only links.
5. For each wheel flagged as missing ``<cylinder>`` collision, author
   the cylinder by hand — measure or estimate radius and length from
   the wheel mesh. The convention is the cylinder's ``length`` axis
   aligned with the wheel's rotation axis.
6. Commit the xacro with the inertial blocks and any wheel-cylinder
   colliders.

    """Detect links that need ``<inertial>`` plus links whose absence is a problem.

    Returns ``(needs_injection, ghost_root_warnings)``.

    The detection rule flags any **non-root link that lacks both
    ``<inertial>`` and ``<collision>``** — that link becomes a massless
    PhysX rigid body and triggers the "possibly invalid inertia tensor /
    negative mass" warning. The 6.0 converter applies ``RigidBodyAPI`` to
    **every** non-ghost-root link, so this includes pure kinematic frames
    (TF anchors, branching mount frames, sensor frames) that have no
    visual or collision — they are NOT exempt. Three cases are excluded:

    * **URDF root link** — KDL (used by ``robot_state_publisher`` and
      MoveIt) requires the root link to be massless. Putting an
      ``<inertial>`` on the root produces "Root link X has inertial
      properties..." warnings and breaks downstream KDL consumers.
      Detected as the unique link that's not the ``<child>`` of any
      ``<joint>``. (Its PhysX "massless root" warning is the documented
      cost of the massless-root + ``_inertia``-sibling pattern.)

    * **``<name>`` + ``<name>_inertia`` sibling pattern** — Universal
      Robots and several other vendors put the actual mass on a separate
      ``*_inertia`` child link connected by a fixed joint, leaving the
      named link as a pure kinematic frame. Injecting on the frame
      partner duplicates mass authored on the inertia partner. Detected
      by literal name lookup.

    * **Links with a ``<collision>``** — PhysX auto-computes mass from the
      collision shape's volume × density, so a missing ``<inertial>`` is
      not a problem for them.

    the real PhysX "possibly invalid inertia tensor" warnings.

    ``ghost_root_warnings`` is a separate channel for URDF root links
    that are pure frames (no visual / collision / inertial). The 6.0
    URDF→USD converter's ``is_ghost_link`` branch produces broken USDs
    for these (every joint's ``body0`` ends up pointing at the
    articulation root Xform instead of the parent link, including fixed
    joints). The tool can't auto-fix this — KDL forbids inertia on the
    root, and adding a visual/collision changes rendering or contact
    behavior. The operator must restructure the URDF (typical fix: a
    non-ghost root such as adding a dummy primitive visual to the root,
    or starting the kinematic chain at a non-ghost link).
